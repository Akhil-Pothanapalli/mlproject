# End-to-End Machine Learning Project

## Overview

This project focuses on selecting the best machine learning (ML) model for predicting student scores. It serves as a learning milestone, providing insights into various ML models, their evaluation, and practical application in predictive analytics. This project is not intended to fulfill a specific business requirement but rather to enhance understanding and skills in ML model selection and performance evaluation.

## Objectives

- To explore and compare different machine learning models.
- To evaluate the performance of each model based on relevant metrics.
- To select the best-performing model for predicting student scores.
- To implement the chosen model and make predictions.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following sections:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Gathering the dataset and preparing it for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding the data through visualization and summary statistics.
3. **Model Selection**: Evaluating multiple ML models to identify the best one.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the models using various metrics to ensure robustness.
5. **Prediction**: Using the selected model to predict student scores.
6. **Conclusion**: Summarizing the findings and reflecting on the learning outcomes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information about students and their academic performance. Key features may include:
